Back when I still shared a computer with all of my brothers, I remember learning just enough CSS to update my MySpace profile. What started as a hobby grew into a part-time job updating e-courses for my university, and later as tech support for a web startup. 

Once I started interfacing directly with users and developers, my assumptions about web technology really began to evolve. And one day, I just decided that being a go-between for devs and users wasn't enough for me anymore. I wanted to be the developer! My experience in tech support advocating for the user while acting as an intermediary for devs has certainly informed the kind of developer I want to be now: focused on the user and invested in the full development lifecycle.

Recently, I graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive—an experience that gave me many opportunities to think up, build, and deploy full-stack applications quickly. This program was such a good fit for me and I learned so much. It also confirmed to me that actualizing beautiful interfaces and tools that anyone can use is difficult and deeply satisfying work for me.

When I'm not trying to apply JS concepts to real life, I like solving crossword puzzles, listening to movie podcasts, and canceling plans.
