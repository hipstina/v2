Back when I still shared a computer with all of my brothers, I remember learning just enough CSS to update my MySpace profile. What started as a hobby grew into a part-time job updating e-courses for my university, and later as tech support for a web startup. 

Once I started interfacing directly with users and developers, my assumptions about web technology really began to evolve. And one day, I just decided that being a go-between for devs and users wasn't enough for me anymore. I wanted to be the developer!

I started by building a small website and learning a little Javascript. I've designed and developed lot of little web apps, mostly built in plain Javascript. Recently, I started learning React and built a calculator.

My experience advocating for the user while acting as an intermediary for devs has certainly informed the kind of developer I want to be now: focused on the user and invested in the full development lifecycle.

When I'm not trying to apply JS concepts to real life, I like solving crossword puzzles, listening to movie podcasts, and canceling plans.
