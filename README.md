## About
I wanted to build my portfolio in a way that will make it easy to update with new projects over time. Inspired by static site generators like 11ty which accept Markdown documents as source files, this is my implementation in React. To accomplish this, I use `react-markdown` to parse the markdown and `gray-matter` to handle the frontmatter. 
### Getting started

Fork and clone:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hipstina/v2.git
```


Install client dependencies:
```sh
npm i
```

Start the development server:
```sh
npm start
```

When you are ready to deploy run the deployment script to get the static files:
```sh
npm run build
```
